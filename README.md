# A little advice for you ❗❗❗

## I usually use "Prettier" to improve my code and make it look cleaner. It is also super useful for those who are starting to program. I know that when we are beginners in writing code, we usually make mistakes or our code looks messier and we can't read it ourselves.

# Prettier definition

## `Prettier` offers support for multiple languages and frameworks. What `Prettier` offers is to take your code and "re-format" it based on the defined settings thus maintaining a consistent style. Making it much more readable and without worrying about how you write it initially.
